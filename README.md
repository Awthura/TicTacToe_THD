To change the default turn between player and ai, please navigate to tictactoe/ai.py and change turn between 1 and 2.

To change the type of AI, also go to tictactoe/ai.py and change the level between 1 and 2.

AI level 1 plays random moves and AI level 2 is supposed to be empowered by minimax, but, there is still a bug with minimax.
